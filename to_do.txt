== TO DO ==

update trainingFeatures.py / make a new script to take box scores for say, the past week, and update 
the training dataset

update the readme

sit down and try to come up with a better idea of
    - which stats from the box scores to include
    - which metrics to calculate (while we're still doing that manually, that is)

write some code to generate a report / summary of the model's performance

start planning the big refactor
    - will enable us to use ML to make the metrics
    - will make it easier to explore different kinds of networks

eventually make a single, user-friendly tool for the guys to actually use
^this is far off since there's a lot that can be done to improve the model performance right now
